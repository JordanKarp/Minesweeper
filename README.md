# Minesweeper

## A game of Minesweeper

## How to play
The grid presented is a 'minefield' filled with mines. The objective of the game is to identify all of the mines, without 'being blown up' (clicking on a mine.) If a space without a mine is chosen, a number will appear, representing the number of mines in the 8 squares immediately adjacent to this square. 

Using these numbers, you can 'flag' the mines by using the right mouse button.
