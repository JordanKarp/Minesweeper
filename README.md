# Minesweeper

## How to play

The grid presented is a 'minefield' filled with mines. The objective of the game is to identify all of the mines, without 'being blown up' (clicking on a mine.) If a space without a mine is chosen, a number will appear, representing the number of mines in the 8 squares immediately adjacent to this square.

Using these numbers, you can 'flag' the mines by using the right mouse button.

You can win by correctly identifying all the mines with flags or by revealing every non-mine loaction!

In the options menu, you can also customize the size of the grid and the number of mines.

Enjoy!
